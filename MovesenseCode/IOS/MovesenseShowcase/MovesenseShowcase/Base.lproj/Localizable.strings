<h3>1. Updating Sensor Firmware</h3>
 <p><a href='applink:dfuUpdate'>See DFU updating instructions here</a></p>

 <p>DFU file format requirements: DFU ZIP package generated by a ninja build tool.</p>

 <h3>2. Recovering from a Failed Sensor Update</h3>
 <p>There are two ways to recover from a failed sensor update:</p>

 <ol>
     <li>If the red LED light is still constantly lit (sensor is still in DFU mode), navigate to “More” and select “DFU
         recovery”.
     </li>
     <li>If the sensor is not in DFU mode (LED light is not on), you can manually set the sensor to DFU mode by removing
         the battery. Then insert the battery while pressing the studs with your finger and keeping them short circuited.
         Remove the finger when LED starts blinking and sensor will end up in DFU mode (LED is constantly lit).
     </li>
 </ol>
 <br>
 <h3>3. Detecting Bluetooth Bandwidth Issues</h3>
 <p>The Bluetooth bandwidth varies a lot between phone models. If you are encountering any of the following issues with
     the app:</p>
 <ol>
     <li>Losing some sensor connection(s) with multi-sensor use case</li>
     <li>Losing data when subscribing higher sample rates or subscribing multiple APIs simultaneously.</li>
 </ol>
 <br>
 <p>We strongly suggest to either have less sensors connected simultaneously of decrease the sample rate and/or amount of
     simultaneous data subscriptions per sensor.</p>
 <h3>4. Connecting Multiple Sensors</h3>
 <p>Connect multiple sensors by adding them individually in the Sensors page. All previously connected sensors are shown
     here. Connect them by tapping <strong>“Connect this sensor”</strong>. You can also connect a new sensor by selecting
     <strong>“+”</strong> from top right corner.</p>
 <p><strong><u>Please note</u></strong>, that the capabilities of connecting multiple sensors depend highly on your phone
     model and the data you are viewing and recording. Try it out freely and remember to give us feedback!</p>

 <h3>5. Data Log Formats</h3>
 <p>Supported data log formats are <strong>CSV</strong> and <strong>JSON</strong>. They can be easily exported and visualized with your favourite tools for
     analyzing.</p>
 <p>Timestamp format in recording is milliseconds since last reset of Movesense sensor.</p>

 <h3>6. Data Missing from a Recorded File</h3>
 <p>You might be encountering some issues with the data bandwidth. Please check the answer to <strong>“3. Detecting Bluetooth Bandwidth Issues”</strong>. Other option is to try to replace the battery with a full one.</p>

 <h3>7. Technical Information of the Sensor</h3>
 <p><a href='https://www.movesense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Movesense-Sensor-Datasheet-_-20171109.pdf'>Download
     the sensor spec sheet</a></p>
 <p>The spec sheet includes all the important information e.g. sensors, software and patents.</p>

 <h3>8. Replacing the Battery in Sensor</h3>
 <p>Open the battery compartment cover using a coin as a tool. Remove the old battery and recycle it according to the
     local legislation. Insert a fresh CR2025 lithium coin cell battery into the battery compartment cover and then press
     the sensor on the battery cover. Firmly close the battery cover. Make sure that the O-ring is in correct position in
     the groove on the battery cover before closing the battery cover.</p>

 <h3>9. What to Do When iPhone Disk Is Full</h3>
 <p>Go to <strong>Settings → General → iPhone Storage</strong> to check what takes up storage on your phone. Tap each app to see how it
     uses storage. If Movesense app is filling your phone with recorded data, go to <strong>Recordings → Select → Share</strong> to export
     your logs. After exporting your logs, delete them to free up disk space.</p>
